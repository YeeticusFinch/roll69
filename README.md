A subtle spin-off of the Roll20 virtual tabletop

## Planned Features:

- 3d maps (2d maps but you can do multiple levels)
- tokens can be represented with either a 3d model or a 2d image
- 3d area effect selectors
- DM layer (players can't see stuff on this layer)
- 3D dice roller
- Saves online in the cloud
